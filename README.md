## USACO Python Bronze Solutions

These are my solutions to some USACO problems with Python. A lot of these were created when I was a beginner and so most, if not, all the code isn't elegant, may not use good coding practices, and may not even be fully efficient. For the most part, the harder problems included were made more recently and have more effective solutions you can use. All of the solutions that are posted in the repo fully work.

Good luck, I hope these solutions help!
